## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Some examples are:

- [Singleton](Singleton)
    - [Lazi Initialization](Singleton/LazyInitialization)
    - [Eager Initialization](Singleton/EagerInitialization)
    - [Double Checked Locking](Singleton/DoubleCheckedLocking)

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplify the structure by identifying the relationships. These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.
