## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Some examples are:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Some examples are:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Some examples are:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Conclusion

Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.
